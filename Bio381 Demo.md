## Typora 



### Part 1: Headers 

That was a H3 header, and a H2 header above :point_up::point_up:

#### This is a H4 header

##### This is a H5 header

###### This is a H6 header



## Part 2: Lists



### Unordered list 

- This is an unordered list, main items 
  - This is a sub-item of my unordered list
    - This is a third sub-item
      - Turtles all the way down
    - Turtles
- Turtles

### Ordered lists

1. You can always type `1. ` to yield an ordered list
2. And the numbering is automatic
   1. It will restart if you indent
3. This one

## Manual line breaks

In order to add manual line breaks, add two spaces.  

This was a manual break. I can't seem to get this one to work. 

This was not. 

### Block quotes



> This is a quotation, captured in a block code



### Code blocks



> Wood accounts for a large part of the production costs of most new home construction projects. If the price of wood increases at the same time that the incomes of most consumers fall, one would expect the equilibrium price of housing (a normal good) to ________, while the equilibrium quanitity __________. 

``` This is a plain code block ```



```R
This is a block of r code (I hope
                         )
```

---



`r 3 + pi`

```R
3 + pi
```



## Simple table 



| Pizzas I enjoy  | Number consumed | Last consumed--- |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Cheese          | 2               | 02/17/2021       |
| Buffalo Chicken | 3               | 02/15/2021       |
|                 |                 |                  |



### Text highlighting



This is a test of ==text highlighting==



### An image

### Equations 



Here is an inline equation $y = \frac{mx + b^2}{\pi}$. And, we might want to make a centered equation: 
$$
BPower_{i} = \alpha + \beta_1 Female + \beta_2 Post + \beta_3 Female X Post + \epsilonâ€‹
$$


### Summary

In summary, Typora is great and I don't understand the manual line break thing.
